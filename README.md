# project 3: Classification of cancer types with Logistic Regression algorithm.
breast cancer dataset involves 31 columns and 569 records.
# Objective: 
1. Build classification model with Logistic Regression to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
2. fine-tune the hyperparameters & evaluation metrics of model.

Description:
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for binary classification where we use a logistic function, also known as a sigmoid function that takes 
input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1. For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an inpu
t is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 it belongs to Class 0. Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly
used for classification problems. The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while 
logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not.

Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world and accounts for 25% of all cancer cases. Breast cancer is a cancer that originates from breast tissue.It begins when
breast cells begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen on an X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area. Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump
in the breast, changes in the shape of the breast, dimpling of the skin, milk discharge, discharge from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or red or scaly patches of skin. There may be bone pain,
swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath or yellowing of the skin.
The main diagnostic challenges are how to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).
We want to classify these tumors using a machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) on the breast cancer dataset.
